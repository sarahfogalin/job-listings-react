## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned the best approach with responsive design is mobile first! Coming from building only mobile applications - for example, React Native - to responsive web apps, I really enjoyed the challenge of making an app both web and mobile friendly. I enjoyed creating the filtering feature of this app and am very happy with the result.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to be able to improve my skills regarding responsive design best practices. Additionally I would love to learn more about different styling tools such as Sass and Bootstrap.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#) - This helped me choose the correct array methods for filtering the job listings.
